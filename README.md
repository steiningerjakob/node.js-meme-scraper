# node.js-meme-scraper

Check out my next **totally awesome** project!

It is a command line app that scrapes a meme website and saves the first 10 images to a predetermined folder.

## Usage:

Just type in *node index.js* in the command line (needs Node.js v16+)

## Output: 

The application will download the first 10 images from the website (https://memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app/) and save it in the memes folder that is being created by the application.
